CanMed, the CANBUS MEDIATOR to DBUS, UDP and RESTful

Events and messages shall be routed between different busses, such as
CANBUS, DBUS, plain UDP and RESTful HTTP.

For example:
* Messages shall be read from CANBUS and forwarded
  to one or more UDP destination (multicast or unicast).
* Messages shall be read from UDP-endpoints (multicast or unicast) 
  and shall be forwarded to a specific CANBUS.

To avoid messages loss due to delays caused by garbage-collectors etc.
C++ has been chosen for the implementation. The architecture is based on 
single threaded, non-blocking asynchronous communication. Events are 
managed by the Glibn-Mainloop being capable to handle various file and 
network events.

Milestones:
0) Setup project 
1) Realize routing between mutiple UDP resources
2) Realize routing between CANBUS and UDP resources
3) Setup test-framework
4) Implement generic adapter for DBUS resources 
5) Implement optional JSON formatting of UDP traffic.

Current state of the  project: Milestone 1

Note:
Thanks to the following howto, I was able to set up the automake environment:
